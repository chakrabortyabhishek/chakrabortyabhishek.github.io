<li><h3>An efficient scheme for constructing small-world machine-to-machine networks (For details, please refer to C14 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>Real-world Machine-to-Machine (M2M) networks comprise of power-constrained sensor nodes to collect data of interest and send it to data aggregators for further processing using multi-hop relaying which increases end-to-end transmission delay. However, in many real-world application scenarios such as low latency communication in a 5G network, there is a strict delay deadline that has to be met. In this work, we proposed Constrained Link Addition Using high Sensor nodes (CLAUSe) to efficiently construct a few long-ranged links among the chosen high sensor nodes (sensor nodes with at least two interfaces) to reduce end-to-end hop distance in a sparse random M2M network setting, thereby, incorporating the small-world characteristics.</p>

<li><h3>An efficient malware detection technique using complex network-based approach (For details, please refer to C13 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>System security is becoming an indispensable part of our daily life due to the rapid proliferation of unknown malware attacks. Recent malware found to have a very complicated structure that is hard to detect by the traditional malware detection techniques such as antivirus, intrusion detection systems, and network scanners. In this work, we proposed a complex network-based malware detection technique, Malware Detection using Complex Network (MDCN), that considers Application Program Interface Call Transition Matrix (API-CTM) to generate complex network topology and then extracts various feature set by analyzing different metrics of the complex network to distinguish malware and benign applications. The generated feature set is then sent to several machine learning classifiers, which include naive-Bayes, support vector machine, random forest, and multi-layer perceptron, to comparatively analyze the performance of MDCN-based technique. The analysis reveals that MDCN shows higher accuracy, with lower false-positive cases, when the multi-layer perceptron-based classifier is used for the detection of malware. MDCN technique can efficiently be deployed in the design of an integrated enterprise network security system.</p>

<li><h3>Corporate linkages and financial performance: A complex network analysis of Indian firms (For details, please refer to J8 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>Corporate governance has a significant impact not only on the behavior and performance of a corporation, but also on the functioning of other corporations, entrepreneurialism in the economy, and the working of capital markets. One way of looking at the effects of corporate governance on the company performance is to study the contributions of the corporate board of directors. In this work, we explored the network of the director boards for the top Indian corporations to better understand the effects of the interlocking of management boards when the financial performance is considered. To study the corporate networks, we collected and analyzed relevant dataset of the top 150 Indian companies on the basis of the maximum revenue generation. We found that the debt to equity ratio, on an average, tends to decrease as the measure of the degree centrality of certain corporation increases. Further, we studied a modularity maximization-based community structure of the network of the director boards to better comprehend the interconnections of the Indian corporates. Moreover, the underlying relationship of the modularity and the corporate performance are also analyzed and it can be observed that most of the top Indian corporations, with low net current asset value per share, belong to the larger communities.</p>

<li><h3>Social network aware dynamic edge server placement for next-generation cellular networks (For details, please refer to C12 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>A social network group, in a 4th Generation Long-Term Evolution (4G LTE) network, consists of multiple users who share information in the social network group and the information is sent to other users through the unicast transmission. As a result, a large amount of operational bandwidth is consumed due to the redundant data transmissions and, thus, the operational latency of the network increases. We aim to reduce the bandwidth consumption and also to minimize the operational latency by optimizing the message transmission over a 4G LTE network with the aid of edge computing. In our experiments, we found that placing edge servers at all the edge locations reduces the transmission delay by approximately 92.64% along with a 51.38% improvement in the network throughput. However, installation of edge servers at all the edge locations, to reduce the transmission of redundant information, is not a feasible and cost-effective solution. In this work, we proposed a novel edge server placement strategy, Social network Aware Dynamic Edge Server placement (SADES), which uses the information from the overlay social network groups to efficiently identify a few influential base stations to place the edge servers, in an existing 4G LTE network. We observe that when a single edge server is placed in an influential base station with SADES, the transmission delay is reduced approximately 68.02% along with 42.45% improvement in the network throughput as compared to an existing 4G LTE network infrastructure with no edge servers. SADES can be utilized to design efficient ultra-reliable and low latency communication-enabled~5th Generation (5G) network.</p>

<li><h3>MACA-I: A malware detection technique using memory management API call mining (For details, please refer to C11 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>Present day malicious software, often encountered in an Internet-enabled electronic system, turn to be extremely difficult to be detected by the existing malware detection solutions. In this work, we introduced a novel malware detection strategy, Memory management with API CAll mIning (MACA-I), that efficiently detects malware based on the dynamic analysis. MACA-I analyzes API calls that are responsible for accessing the system memory and, thereby, generates required features by observing the transitions of memory management APIs as well as the allocated memory block space during the runtime. We find that MACA-I is approximately 95.45% accurate while detecting malware programs on the basis of system memory-related runtime behavior.</p>

<li><h3>On the evolution of finite-sized complex networks with constrained link addition (For details, please refer to C10 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>Scale-free characteristics, where degree distribution of a network follows the power-law distribution, are observed in most of the existing real-world complex networks. Barab√°si and Albert first studied the evolution of random complex networks and observed that complex networks with node growth via preferential attachment can evolve to be scale-free. However, some complex networks such as neural networks inside the human brain, employees of an organization, and networks of closed social groups can be considered finite-sized complex networks which are relatively static with respect to the number of nodes where only the number of edges grow with time. This work studied the gradual evolution of such finite-sized complex networks. It can be observed from our study that a finite-sized complex network, with average path optimal edge growth, evolves as the following: a regular network ‚Üí a small-world network ‚Üí a scale-free network ‚Üí a scale-free network with the truncated degree distribution ‚Üí a fully connected network with unconstrained link addition. Therefore, it can be concluded that in finite-sized complex networks edge growth can result in transitional scale-free networks.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>ACTM: API call transition matrix-based malware detection method (For details, please refer to C9 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>Traditional malware detection techniques, such as signature-based detection and traditional antivirus software, are not beneficial for detecting many recent malware threats. In this work, we proposed a novel malware detection technique, API call transition matrix-based malware detection (ACTM), that efficiently detects malware based on their runtime behavior. We find that the ACTM technique performs better and detects malware with approximately 95.23% accuracy. ACTM can find applications in designing real-time malware detection when an enterprise network security system is concerned.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Deterministic evolution through indexed leaf node based attachment in complex networks (For details, please refer to C8 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>Complex networks are abstract graphs where the nodes are real-world entities and their relationships can be imitated as links. The relationships among various real-world entities are neither entirely random nor fully regular, thus, the structures of evolving complex networks are non-trivial in nature. To study the characteristics of such evolving complex networks, efficient network models, that can emulate the real-world networks, are needed. In this work, a novel network model, deterministic evolution through leaf node attachment (DELNA), that can efficiently emulate many real-world networks, such
as technological networks, social networks, and other man-made networks, is proposed. We also compare our DELNA-based network model with a few existing network evolution models, namely Barab√°si-Ravasz-Vicsek deterministic network model and Barab√°si-Albert network evolution model. DELNA can find applications in the Internet of things and the satellite communications, where the network resilience is a very crucial parameter.</p>

<li><h3>GFT centrality: A new node importance measure for complex networks (For details, please refer to J7 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>Identifying central nodes is very crucial to design efficient communication networks or to recognize key individuals of a social network. In this work, we introduced Graph Fourier Transform Centrality (GFT-C), a metric that incorporates local as well as global characteristics of a node, to quantify the importance of a node in a complex network. GFT-C of a reference node in a network is estimated from the GFT coefficients derived from the importance signal of the reference node. Our study reveals the superiority of GFT-C over traditional centralities such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and Google PageRank centrality, in the context of various arbitrary and real-world networks with different degree‚Äìdegree correlations.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Link influence entropy (For details, please refer to J6 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>In this work we proposed a new metric, Link Influence Entropy (LInE), which describes importance of each node based on the influence of each link present in a network. Influence of a link can neither be effectively estimated using betweenness centrality nor using degree based probability measures. The proposed LInE metric which provides an effective way to estimate the influence of a link in the network and incorporates this influence to identify nodal characteristics, performs better compared to degree based entropy. We found that LInE can differentiate various network types which degree-based or betweenness centrality based node influence metrics cannot. Our findings show that spatial wireless networks and regular grid networks, respectively, have lowest and highest LInE values. Finally,
performance analysis of LInE is carried out on a real-world network as well as on a wireless mesh network testbed to study the influence of our metric as well as influence stability of nodes in dynamic networks.</p>

<li><h3>A multi-backup path protection scheme for survivability in elastic optical networks (For details, please refer to J5 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>Two important challenges in designing a survivable optical network are minimizing backup spectrum allocation and ensuring spectrum assignment constraints. Allocating backup spectrum is one important
approach for survivable optical network design. Connection requests which are rejected due to the unavailability of a single backup path can be survived using multiple backup routes. Multiple backup
routes not only increase connection acceptance rate, but also improve backup resource sharing. In this work, we presented a strategy for survivability which optimizes primary and backup spectrum allocations and multiple backup route assignments for surviving a connection request. In our strategy, named as Backup Spectrum Reservation with MultiPath Protection (BSR-MPP), multiple backup routes are searched over advance reserved backup resources when an optical connection is concerned. Simulation results show that confinement of backup resources result in higher resource sharing and assignment of multiple backup lightpaths. It can also be observed that BSR-MPP has lower Bandwidth Blocking Probability and higher spectrum efficiency as compared to conventional Shared Path Protection (SPP) and MultiPath Protection (MPP) strategies.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>On spectral analysis of node centralities (For details, please refer to C7 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>In this work, we studied spectral properties of node centralities such as degree, closeness, and betweenness centralities, by utilizing graph Fourier transform. We considered node centralities as signals on various networks, namely, regular, random, small-world, and scale-free networks. The spectral analysis helps us to easily understand centrality patterns over various networks. We observe spectral patterns for different network models and subsequently classify networks from the spectra of node centralities.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Analytical identification of anchor nodes in a small-world network (For details, please refer to J4 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>Addition of new links in a communication network or formation of new social ties in a social network is an important way to improve the performance of the respective networks. In this work, we consider the optimal link addition for a string network in order to minimize the average path length for the network. In prior work, the optimal addition of links to a string network has been found to lead to a network where all the added links are incident to a single anchor node. Furthermore, the position of the anchor node has been found to be fixed at either approximately 0.2 or 0.8 of the total number of nodes in the string network. In this letter, we provide an analytical justification for this observation and, in the process, identify the fixed fractional positions of the anchor nodes. We also discuss the significance of the anchor nodes for a string network, which is an important network model for several real-world communication and social networks.</p>

<li><h3>Graph Fourier transform based on directed Laplacian (For details, please refer to C6 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>In this work, we redefine the graph Fourier transform (GFT) under the DSP G framework. We consider the Jordan eigenvectors of the directed Laplacian matrix as graph harmonics and the corresponding eigenvalues as the graph frequencies. For this purpose, we propose a shift operator based on the directed Laplacian of a graph. Based on our shift operator, we then define total variation of graph signals, which is used for frequency ordering. We achieve natural frequency ordering as well as interpretation via the proposed definition of GFT. Moreover, we show that our proposed shift operator makes linear shift invariant (LSI) filters under DSP G to become polynomials in the directed Laplacian.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Conflict graph based community detection (For details, please refer to C5 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>Community is a network‚Äôs subgraph where vertices share similar properties and reflect interesting characteristics for understanding complex networks more closely. Therefore, community structure analysis is important in understanding and exploring complex networks and helps in describing relationship among nodes in a network. However, efficiently finding communities in a complex network still remains an open problem. Since there exists numerous ways of defining a community, existing strategies have adopted different parameters to reflect varied behavior of a community structure and trying to give a coarser or finer community distribution. In this work, we propose Conflict graph Transform based Community Detection (CTCD) strategy to improve the quality of community distributions. CTCD focuses on the impact of degree of influence to detect more favorable community partitions. A well known measure, known as Surprise, is used to evaluate and compare the quality of the community distributions obtained using CTCD. Finally, in order to study the performance and usefulness of our strategy, CTCD is applied in real-world networks. Using CTCD, we are able to obtain better community distributions with higher Surprise value in real-world networks. We observe that 1-hop and 2-hop influences improve the Surprise value in higher and lower average clustering coefficient networks, respectively. Moreover, CTCD can efficiently extract the hierarchical nature of communities within networks.</p>

<li><h3>Influence of greedy reasoning on network evolution (For details, please refer to C4 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>Power-law degree distribution is observed in many real-world complex networks and thus, they are called scale-free networks. Barab√°si et al. first observed this scale-free characteristics in natural as well as human-made networks and stated that network growth and preferential attachment of new network nodes are the two key ingredients for transforming a real-world network to a scale-free network. We observe, in this work, that addition of links while greedily optimizing an appropriate objective is another reason for transformation of a regular network to a scale-free network. Moreover, we observe that pure random addition is unable to realize scale-free networks.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>An efficient heuristics to realize near-optimal small-world networks (For details, please refer to C3 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>Small-world characteristic brings down average path length of a network by adding a few long-links among network node-pairs. In a real-world deployment scenario, probabilistic long-link addition cannot guarantee optimal value of average path length for a network with limited number of long-links. In this work, we propose a generalized heuristic, Sequential Deterministic Long-link Addition (SDLA) algorithm to incorporate small-world property for moderate sized string topology networks. Our proposed algorithm has O(k √ó N) time complexity compared to O(N^2(k+2) √ó log N) for optimal and O(k √ó N^4 √ó log N) for near-optimal long-link addition strategies for k long links when a string topology network of size N is concerned. Our studies show that SDLA algorithm negligibly deviates in various network properties (e.g., average path length, average clustering coefficient, and graph centralities) from the optimal and near-optimal solutions.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Communication overhead of an OpenFlow wireless mesh network (For details, please refer to C2 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>OpenFlow is a new paradigm for running experimental protocols on production networks, and is becoming a standard reference for implementation of the software defined networking. OpenFlow can be deployed on wireless mesh network, a multi-hop relaying wireless network, for efficient network traffic management. Furthermore, various challenges such as load-balancing and control traffic management of wireless mesh networks can be effectively handled with the OpenFlow central controller. In this work, we develop an OpenFlow wireless mesh network testbed to investigate various performance metrics (e.g., throughput, latency, CPU usage, and control traffic) for full mesh and partial mesh network topologies. Furthermore, we measure empirical controller capacity, a new metric we defined to evaluate
the OpenFlow wireless mesh network controller performance. We also address various implementation challenges of real-world OpenFlow wireless mesh networks.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>The reason behind the scale-fee world (For details, please refer to J3 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>Most of the real-world networks, existing in nature or observed in the world of technology, follow the power-law degree distribution, and thus, they are called scale-free networks. Barab√°si first observed that the scale-free network is formed by preferential attachment of new nodes in the existing network. Therefore, a new node is more likely to make a connection with a node having higher neighbor degree in the network. In this work, we find that greedy decision making is one of the key characteristics for the transformation of a regular network to a scale-free network. Greedy decision making results in long-ranged link affinity, a phenomenon responsible for hub-node creation in the network. Moreover, we show that pure random addition of new links in a regular network does not result in a
scale-free network.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Delay optimized small-world networks (For details, please refer to J2 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>Many regular networks suffer from significant network delay due to large end-to-end hop distance among source nodes and destination nodes in the network. However, the presence of a few long-ranged links transforms a regular network to a small-world network, and thus, optimizes network delay by minimizing end-to-end hop distance. In this work, we study various deterministic long-ranged link addition strategies (e.g., based on average path length, average edge length, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and closeness centrality disparity) to incorporate small-world characteristics as well as to optimize average network delay of the network. Moreover, we analyze time complexity to assess the efficiency of each strategy in detail. We observe, in an N node network, that deterministic long-ranged
link addition by closeness centrality disparity (CCD) strategy is only O(N^2 √ó log N) time complex compared to other optimal long-ranged link addition strategies which take O(N^4 √ó log N) time to achieve similar performance in the context of average network delay.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Load-aware routing for non-persistent small-world wireless mesh networks (For details, please refer to C1 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>Wireless mesh network is a distributed multi-hop relaying network. A large scale wireless mesh network typically has high value of network average path length which results in reduced throughput and increased delay in the network. Average path length can be reduced in the network by implementing a few long-links among the network node-pairs, and thus introduces the small-world characteristics in the wireless mesh networks. However, the conventional routing algorithms are not optimized for small-world wireless mesh networks. In this work, we propose a Load-aware Non-Persistent small-world long-
link Routing (LNPR) algorithm for small-world wireless mesh networks to achieve lower average transmission path length for data transfer sessions among a set of source-node and destination-node pairs in the network. LNPR uses load balancing strategy to better distribute the network traffic among the normal-links and the non-persistent long-links in the small-world wireless mesh networks for efficient use of long-links which are precious data transmission paths in the network. LNPR provides 58% to 95% improvement in call blocking probability and 23% to 70% in maximum load reduction with increment ranging from only 0.7% to 9% increase in average transmission path length. Small-world wireless mesh networks find numerous applications in rural and community networks for cost-effective communication.</p>

<li><h3>Capacity calculation and sub-optimal power allocation scheme for OFDM-based systems (For details, please refer to J1 in <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>)</h3>
<p>For emerging cellular wireless systems, the mitigation of inter-cell interference is the key to achieve a high capacity and good user experience. This work is devoted to the performance analysis of interference mitigation techniques for the downlink channel in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) network, with a focus on the Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) standard. We derive a general closed-form equation of the system capacity, considering multiple cells, and investigate a coordination technique for the interference mitigation.</p>
